# Normalization and ER-diagram

Take a look at the following ER diagram.

![Start ER diagram](img/exercise-start-er.png)

The ER-diagram describes a possible database design for managing students, examinations and scores. The database design is not normalized. Try to normalize this database to NF2 (if possible you can also try to get it in NF3).

Describe the steps you need to follow to get the database in NF1, NF2 and NF3 in the following chapters.

## Normalizing the database

### Converting to the first normal form (NF1)

<!-- TODO: describe the steps you followed and show the resulting ER diagram -->

### Converting to the first normal form (NF2)

<!-- TODO: describe the steps you followed and show the resulting ER diagram -->

### Converting to the first normal form (NF3) (optional)

<!-- TODO: describe the steps you followed and show the resulting ER diagram -->

## ER-diagrams

For the normalized database, create an **conceptual**, **logical** and **physical** ER diagram.

### Conceptual ER-diagram

### Logical ER-diagram

<!-- TODO: Place your solution image here -->

### Physical ER-diagram

<!-- TODO: Place your solution image here -->

## Need to knows and remarks
<!--
Here you should place extra remarks that the teacher needs to know to get the solution working. For example if one needs to change some configuration file or install some extra libraries or whatever. There is also room for extra remarks you would like to make that you were not able to fit inside one of the sections above.
